### Problem Solved

CAREgivers Insight’s mobile app removes limitations of paper forms and summaries with comprehensive information that’s easy to understand.  Caregivers answer customized questions based on one’s diagnosis, with menu-driven answers. Answers are transformed into graphs and trend lines you can share with others.  

✓  Recognize and treat potential issues early

✓  Empower caregivers to alter care routines in real-time

✓  Share health details with everyone in the circle of care

✓  No typing or texting summaries

✓  Reduce unnecessary doctor and hospital visits

✓ Accurately administer and track medications

### Technologies Used

Written in Dart using the Flutter framework, the app is designed to work on both iOS and Android devices. The app uses AWS Amplify to store and retrieve data from the cloud.
